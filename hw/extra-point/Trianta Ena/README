## Trianta Ena

#### I. The Game:
The objective of the game is to accumulate a hand of cards that equals 31 (Trianta ena!) 
or a hand that has a card value greater than that of the Dealers without exceeding 31.

#### II. The Players:
This is a game with multiple players: 
* The Dealer, referred to as the Banker: distributes cards and pays out the winners
from amount of money held in the Bank.
* The Players (usually no more than seven or nine) : human players who face the 
dealer. If the player loses they pay the Banker the amount equal to their bet. The 
banker accumulates the winnings.

#### III. The Rules:
Each player begins with $100; 
the Banker begins with three times the amount of the Players, which is $300.

Trianta Ena consists of continuous rounds of play with the same original deck(s), 
reshuffled as needed.

Each round the Player may bet any amount of currency up to the total amount they have. 
If the Player wins, they keep their bet and receive an equal amount of their bet from the 
Banker. Otherwise, the Player gives the entirety of the bet to the Banker.

To start each round, the Dealer deals one card to each player. The card that the Players
are dealt is kept face down and known only to each Player. The first card the Dealer is 
dealt is kept face up and known to all the Players and the Dealer. After each player 
receives their first card, they place their bet or choose to fold without betting. Once all 
bets have been made, each player with a standing bet receives two more cards face up. 
After each player has three cards (one down, two up), each Player in turn may take one of 
the following actions:

* Hit : The Players continue to receive another card
* Stand : The Player ends and maintains the value of the current hand

If the player chooses to take another card and his hand is bust, that player must pay the 
banker the total amount of their bet. Play continues with the next player.

Once all the Players stand or have gone bust, the dealer reveals their face down card to 
the Players, and continues to take a hit until the hand value of the Banker reaches or 
exceeds 27.

After each round, all bankrupt players left the game automatically. The game continues 
until all the players has left.

#### IV. The Cards:
The game is played using two standard 52 card decks. Each card has a face value, King, 
Queen, and Jack have a face value of 10; the Ace can have a face value of 1 or 11. If the 
hand consists of one Ace, the player can choose to count it as a 1 or an 11. If the hand 
consists of more than one Ace, only one Ace can count as 1. All others have a value of 11.

The cards are reshuffled once all the cards have been used up.

#### V. The Winner:
There can be multiple winners in each round. In general, the winner of a round is any 
Player who has a hand value higher than that of the Dealer without having gone bust. In 
the case of a tie, the Dealer wins. 

A special case includes natural Trianta Ena versus the hand value of a 31. A natural 
Trianta Ena is defined as a hand having a value of 31 (i.e. an Ace and two face cards). 
While a value of 31 can be any amount of cards (e.g. a 9, 2, and two face cards). Natural 
Trianta Ena always triumphs over a value of 31. A natural 31 of the Banker results in the 
Banker winning the bets from all players.

#### VI. Rotating the Banker:
At the end of each round, the player with the largest total cash amount exceeding that of 
the Banker, is automatically to become the Banker and he/she cannot decline.
